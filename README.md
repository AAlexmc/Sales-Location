# Sales-Location

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Do you want to sell an improved version of an existing product but don't know which city to start in? Here's a small code example that might interest you, along with how to edit it to help you.

## Background

Many businesses struggle to identify the best locations to launch new products. This problem is common among startups and small businesses that lack the resources for extensive market research. My personal motivation for this project is to provide a data-driven solution to help businesses make informed decisions about product launches. This topic is important because it can significantly impact the success of a product and the overall growth of a business.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:

· Identifying the best city to launch a product
· Reducing the risk of product launch failures
· Providing a data-driven approach to market analysis


## How is it used?

Instructions for Running the Sales-Location Project

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Open your terminal and execute the following command to install the necessary libraries:


pip install pandas plotly Flask scikit-learn


Step 2: Unzip the Project Files

Unzip the Sales-Location.zip file. Inside, you will find two Python scripts (Sales-Location.py and DataBaseGenerator.py) and a folder named templates containing HTML files.

Step 3: Generate the Database

First, run the DataBaseGenerator.py script to create the database. This script will generate purchase histories for 200 individuals over 6 years for each of the 4 communities. Once the .csv file is generated, save it.

Step 4: Run the Sales-Location Script

Next, execute the Sales-Location.py script. This will open a web browser and redirect you to an HTML page. Follow these steps:

Upload the CSV File: Select the .csv file you generated earlier (e.g., X.csv, where X is the name you gave to your database).
Analyze the Data:
Select the product you want to analyze from the available options.
Click on the analyze button, and the page will display the results of the analysis.

I hope this helps! 😊

## Data sources and AI methods
The data comes from CSV files uploaded by the user, containing historical purchase data. The machine learning model used is a RandomForestClassifier from the Scikit-learn library. The model is trained to predict the most purchased product based on features such as total purchases and purchase frequency.

## Challenges

This project does not solve all aspects of market analysis. Limitations include:

The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and quantity of the data.
The model may not generalize well to new, unseen data.
Ethical considerations include ensuring data privacy and avoiding biases in the model.

## What next?

To further develop this project, the following steps could be taken:

Incorporate more advanced machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
Collect more diverse datasets to enhance the model's generalizability.
Collaborate with domain experts to refine the analysis and interpretation of results.
